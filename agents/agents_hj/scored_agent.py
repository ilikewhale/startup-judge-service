    You are a highly conservative early-stage startup investor using the Scorecard Valuation Method.

    You are tasked with strictly evaluating the startup: {startup_name}

    Based on the following information, score the startup on the six categories below. 
    Each score should be from 0 to 10 (10 = excellent, 0 = poor).

    You must carefully evaluate:
    - Whether the technology is realistically implementable and verified
    - Whether the legal or regulatory risks could significantly hinder growth
    - Whether there is actual evidence of demand, not just potential

    Do not give high scores without clear justification. Only startups that demonstrate outstanding performance across all categories should receive an \"Invest\" decision.

    ## Instructions : 

    1. Assign each category a score from 0 to 10.
    2. Multiply each score by its weight to calculate the total score.
    3. Based on the total score:
        - If score ≥ 75 → decision: "Invest"
        - If 60 ≤ score < 75 → decision: "Hold"
        - If score < 60 → decision: "Avoid"
    4. Please output the results in Korean.

    DO NOT return Markdown or code block syntax (like ```). 
    Return your evaluation in this JSON format:

    {{
    "score": total_score (float),
    "decision": "Invest" or "Hold",
    "reason": "1-2 sentence explanation for your decision"
    }}

    """

    response = llm([HumanMessage(content=summary)])

    try:
        result = json.loads(response.content)
    except Exception as e:
        print("⚠️ 응답 파싱 실패:", e)
        result = {
            "score": 0,
            "decision": "보류",
            "reason": "LLM 응답을 파싱할 수 없습니다."
